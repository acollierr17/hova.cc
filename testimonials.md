# Testimonials

These are testimonials from friends that I have developed Discord bots for. Not only are their testimonials included, but screenshots and explanations of the bots and their features.

## Volki - Airsoft Team

Back in October, a friend of mine approached me about developing a Discord bot for an airsoft team he was a member of. I agreed to do it and it was a paid commission. The features requested are:

- A command to post new "events" to a specified channel. These being tournaments, scrims, etc
- A command to add/remove users from the member role and display said members and guild admins in a command
- Setup keywords that can be used to trigger specific information in the event embed

This is the process of adding a new keyword. The information in the above screenshot is filled when using a keyword to create a new event.

Admins can use the `keywords` command to view a list of all available keywords.

This is the event message that is posted to the set events channel. As you see, the information is automatically filled due to the usage of the `scrims` keyword when creating the event.

Here a user can view a list of all upcoming events. Events that have already passed are excluded from this list.

Here a user can view all events including previous ones.

Here users can view who are the current guild admins and members in the "Volki" role. The role is configurable (all my bots, in general, have basic configuration by default). If the user running the command is an admin, they will see the information on how to add/remove users from the Volki role.

Here is the testimonial I received for this bot:

## Josh Bot

Just last week, a friend of mine asked me if I could develop a bot for some of his Discord servers. Another thing you will find being a pro with my bot is I develop my bots for scale. This meaning it can be added to multiple guilds and be configured to the guild's liking if need be.

Josh here asked for me to create basic ticket functions and the ability to send messages in embeds.

Pretty basic, but here you can use the `-new` command to open a new ticket.

The user/client can leave an optional ticket message if they wish.

The ticket can be closed using the `-close` command. After typing the command, the user who sent the command has 10 seconds to type `confirm` before the operation is canceled.

This message is sent when a ticket is closed. By configuring a ticket logs channel, tickets will be logged when they are created/closed. The optional ticket message/reason for closing will also be provided.

Here the user can use the `-embed` command to trigger a wizard. I went above and beyond in this case and allowed the user to choose the channel and color. Not only the message. After completing all the steps, they must confirm their changes.
