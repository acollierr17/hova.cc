<h1>Josh Bot</h1>

<h2>Bot Permissions</h2>
<p>By default, the bot is assigned the permissions listed below. It is only assigned the permissions it needs. Keep in mind removing some of these permissions may interfere with the functionality of the bot, so it's recommended to keep the assigned permissions unchanged.</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage Channels <code>MANAGE_CHANNELS</code></li>
<li>View Channels <code>VIEW_CHANNELS</code></li>
<li>Send Messages <code>SEND_MESSAGES</code></li>
<li>Manage Messages <code>MANAGE_MESSAGES</code></li>

</ul>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>When you invite the bot to your server, you will need to set up a few things</p>
<ul>
<li>Your desired prefix</li>
<li>The category will ticket channels will go</li>
<li>The channel where ticket logs will be posted</li>
<li>The role that will be added to a ticket upon creation</li>
</ul>
<p>###The prefix
The default bot prefix is <code>-</code>. But you may change it at any time by using the <code>setprefix</code> command. Usage is below:</p>
<pre><code>-setprefix &lt;prefix&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The bot's mention <code>(@Josh Bot#8286)</code> may also be used as a prefix for commands:</p>
<pre><code>@Josh Bot#8286 ping
</code></pre>
<p>If you ever forget the bot's prefix, simply mention it to see what it is.</p>
<h3>Tickets category</h3>
<p>All new tickets will be posted under a category at your choosing. By default, the category the bot will search for is <code>Tickets</code>. You may set a new tickets category by using the <code>setcategory</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>-setcategory &lt;category&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>Tickets logs</h3>
<p>When a ticket is created or closed, it will be logged to a set ticket logs channel. By default, the channel the bot will search for is <code>ticket-logs</code>. You may set a new tickets logs channel by using the <code>setlogs</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>-setlogs &lt;channel&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>Tickets staff role</h3>
<p>A staff role is to be set when using tickets. This role will automatically be added to the ticket when it's created. However, server admins (users who have the <code>Manage Server [MANAGE_GUILD]</code>) will be added automatically. You may add or remove the tickets staff role by using the <code>role</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>-role &lt;add/remove&gt; &lt;role&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you wish to view all server admins and the staff role, you may run the <code>roles</code> command. It'll display an embedded of said information.</p>
